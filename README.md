## Week 2 Report
Here's my understanding of how to use Grasshopper to create a cellphone stand. It starts with setting up the parameters, then we go on to make two separate things:
1. a cellphone
2. a stand

The cellphone is basically a cylinder and the stand is created through creating a sphere, and then subtracting a smaller sphere to create walls, then subtract a cylinder to make space for the cellphone.

To mess with the parameters and dimensions of the stand, I first adjusted the radius of the two spheres:

Then, I tried to replace the cylinder with a cone:

It was very cool to see how easily I can reshape the design with very simple instructions. However, I can't manage to make the end result stay "green." Some errors always occured when I tried to play with the parameters.

Lastly, I tried to replicate TJ's demo during Monday's class and create a box with a hallowed cylinder inside:

Here is the Grasshooper commands I used to achieve the modeling above:

I'm somewhat happy with the end result as it was the first thing I ever created via Grasshopper. I feel like I'm starting to get a hang of it thought process behind how Grasshopper works.


## Week 1 Report
For this past week, I've started using Github for the first time. I've also started learning Rhino from beginning.

It's daunting to learn Rhino and can't say I fully understand how it works, but I'm also excited :)

I was able to make something simple in GH by the end of the week, so I consider it a major achievement:
